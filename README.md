DistriCheck
===========

Very quick instructions on how to use...

The [Apache Commons CLI](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/download_cli.cgi) jar file must be in the classpath for the software to compile. Moreover you also need to install [NuSMV](http://nusmv.fbk.eu/bin/bin_download2-v2.cgi) and make sure it is in the system's path.

Once this is done, the main class is located in ca.uqac.net.dim.verify.NetworkChecker, which you can invoke using command-line arguments that are documented.
